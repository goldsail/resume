\section{Experience}

\cventry{Summer 2019}{Full-stack Developer Intern}{ByteDance}{Beijing, China}{}{
Built a user-firendly Content Management System (CMS) independently, both front-end in \url{React JS} and back-end in \url{Go}.
With my work deployed in the finance and stocks team, 
product managers can view statistics, 
customer service team can adjust orders or refunds, 
and developers can edit configurations on their browser visually.
}

\cventry{Spring 2019}{Undergraduate Degree Thesis}{Tsinghua University}{Beijing, China}{}{
Built a intelligent transportation simulation software featuring semi-physical simulation in \url{C++}.
Refactored decade-old codes into a new distributed architecture and upgraded it to \url{C++ 14}.
}

\cventry{Summer 2018}{Mechanical Systems Control Lab}{University of California, Berkeley}{Berkeley, CA}{}{
Built an autonomous driving simulator using Unreal Engine 4 in \url{C++}.
Designed the system in C/S architecture with PhD students and implemented it independently.
Spotted and fixed a bug with the sample code in UE4, my pull request later merged on GitHub. 
}

\cventry{Fall 2017}{Compiler Course Project}{Tsinghua University}{Beijing, China}{}{
Built a compiler for some LL(0) VM-based language using recursive descent.
One-pass tokenizer, one-pass state-machine-based synctax analyzer, one-pass VM bytecode generator.
}

\cventry{Fall 2017}{Computational Photography Lab}{Tsinghua University}{Beijing, China}{}{
Built an app in which researchers could see and control the microscope with VR glasses.
Ported code from original microscope controller (desktop C++) to Android app.
The app sends user input in TCP and receives microscope video streams in UDP.
The users could move and zoom the microscope by rotating the phone so that they could focus on the field of view.
}

\cventry{Summer 2016}{C++/OOP Course Project}{Tsinghua University}{Beijing, China}{}{
Built a train ticket booking system in OOP design.
Designed database tables (routes, trains, itenaries, orders, etc.) independently.
Back-end server in C\#, user client and administrator client in C\# WinForm.
}
